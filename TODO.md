# TO-DO List

- Low Priority
  - Make simple resource generator (needs economy system first)
  - Climate habitability factor
  - Climate resource yield factor (needs economy system first)

- Optional
  - "From Image" setting for every layer
  - Preview gen: use an external palette file for topography coloring mode
  - Improve climate generator
    - Montane/Alpine climate at high altitude?
    - Hydro layer (rivers?) (random noise vs simulation)

## TO-DO List 2

- Everything

- High Priority
  - Core app code: load world, ui (camera zoom/movement + config), config, map display
  - New scenario generation
  - Time flow and time flow control
  - Basic Polity (map grabbing) component

- Low Priority
  - Save/Load a simulation in progress
    - Guarantee determinism as long as the seeds match
